make sure everytime you change a file, you add it to changelog.txt file, the format should be:

[DATE] [TIME] [FILE] [DESCRIPTION]

Never delete any text from the changelog.txt file. Only add to it.

Never make assumptions about variable names, or existing files. Always check the codebase first, or ask me to give you clarification. 

Always check which files could be affecting a given page, and check those files first before making any assumptions.
