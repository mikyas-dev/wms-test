# Development Tasks

## 1. Stock Management Implementation

### Task 1: Undo/Redo Functionality
Implement a system-wide undo/redo feature for:
- Stock movements
- Stock removals
- Putaway operations

Requirements:
- Track all operations in a history stack
- Allow undoing multiple operations
- Show clear feedback when operations are undone

### Task 2: Stock Movement Validation
Add validation to prevent:
- Moving more stock than available
- Moving to invalid locations
- Creating negative stock levels

### Task 3: Audit Trail
Implement an audit trail showing:
- What changed
- When it changed
- Who made the change
- Previous and new values

## 2. UI Improvements

### Task 1: Mobile Optimization
- Improve mobile layout
- Add touch-friendly controls
- Optimize barcode scanning for mobile devices

### Task 2: Error Handling
- Add clear error messages
- Implement error boundaries
- Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

## 3. Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for critical flows
- Include test coverage reports

## Evaluation Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated on:
1. Code quality and organization
2. Error handling and edge cases
3. UI/UX design
4. Test coverage
5. Performance considerations
6. Documentation
