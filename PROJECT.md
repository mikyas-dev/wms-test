Data Structure Outline

To build a simple yet functional Warehouse Management System, we'll define the core data structures that represent your warehouse's operations. Since you're comfortable with Next.js and prefer to handle everything within it, we'll assume the use of a database like PostgreSQL (since you have experience with it) and possibly an ORM like Prisma for database interactions.

Locations

Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the location.
aisle: String or integer representing the aisle (e.g., "A").
bay: String or integer representing the bay number (e.g., "01").
height: String or integer representing the shelf height (e.g., "01").
label: Computed field combining aisle, bay, and height (e.g., "A-01-01").
Description:

Represents each specific storage spot in the warehouse.
Allows for easy identification and retrieval of items.
Items

Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the item.
sku: Stock Keeping Unit, unique to each item type.
name: Descriptive name of the item.
description: Detailed information about the item.
barcode: Barcode string associated with the item.
Description:

Catalog of all items that can be stored in the warehouse.
Facilitates tracking and management of inventory.
Stock

Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the stock record.
item_id: Foreign key linking to the Items table.
location_id: Foreign key linking to the Locations table.
quantity: Number of units available at the location.
Description:

Allows for quick lookup of where items are stored.
Transactions

Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the transaction.
timestamp: Date and time when the transaction occurred.
item_id: Foreign key linking to the Items table.
from_location_id: Foreign key (nullable) for moves/removals.
to_location_id: Foreign key (nullable) for moves/additions.
quantity: Number of units involved in the transaction.
transaction_type: Type of transaction (e.g., "add", "remove", "move").
user_id (optional): Identifier for the user performing the transaction.
Description:

Logs all inventory movements for auditing and tracking purposes.
Helps maintain data integrity and traceability.
Users (Optional)

Fields:

id: Unique identifier for the user.
username: User's login name.
password_hash: Encrypted password for security.
role: Defines access level (e.g., "staff", "admin").

For an MVP, user authentication can be simplified or omitted.
Page Descriptions and Functionality

The following pages outline the user interface and interactions required for your staff to manage warehouse stock using their mobile phones.

Login Page (Optional for MVP)

Functionality:
Allows users to log in with a username and password.
Authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can access the system.
Notes:
For an MVP, you may skip authentication to simplify development.
If included, ensure secure password handling and session management.
Dashboard/Home Page

Functionality:
Provides an overview of warehouse operations.
Displays total stock counts, recent transactions, and alerts for low stock.
Includes a search bar for quick item or location lookup.
Features navigation links to other pages (Add Stock, Remove Stock, etc.).
Notes:
Should be mobile-responsive for ease of use on phones.
Can use charts or simple lists to present information clearly.
Add Stock Page

Functionality:
Enables staff to add new stock to a location.
Fields:
Item Barcode/SKU: Scanned or manually entered to identify the item.
Location Label: Scanned or entered to specify where the item is stored.
Quantity: Number of units to add.
Process:
Staff scans the item's barcode.
Scans the location's label.
Enters the quantity being added.
Submits the form to update the system.
Backend Actions:
Updates the Stock table with the new quantity.
Creates a new record in the Transactions table with type "add".
Notes:
Include validation to ensure data accuracy (e.g., positive quantities).
Provide confirmation messages upon successful addition.
Remove Stock Page

Functionality:
Allows removal of stock from a location (e.g., for orders or disposal).
Fields:
Item Barcode/SKU: Identifies the item being removed.
Location Label: Specifies the item's current location.
Quantity: Number of units to remove.
Process:
Staff scans the item's barcode and location label.
Enters the quantity to remove.
Submits the form to update the system.
Backend Actions:
Decreases the quantity in the Stock table.
Ensures the quantity does not drop below zero.
Records the transaction with type "remove".
Notes:
Implement checks to prevent negative stock levels.
Provide alerts if attempting to remove more stock than available.
Move Stock Page

Functionality:
Facilitates moving stock from one location to another.
Fields:
Item Barcode/SKU: Item to move.
From Location Label: Current location.
To Location Label: Destination location.
Quantity: Number of units to move.
Process:
Staff scans the item and both location labels.
Enters the quantity to move.
Submits to update the system.
Backend Actions:
Decreases quantity at the from-location.
Increases quantity at the to-location.
Records the transaction with type "move".
Notes:
Ensure that moving stock does not violate stock levels at the origin.
Provide a summary of the move for confirmation.
Stock Lookup Page

Functionality:
Allows users to search for an item and view its stock levels across the warehouse.
Search Options:
By SKU/Barcode: Direct lookup using unique identifiers.
By Name: Search based on item descriptions.
Display:
List of all locations where the item is stored.
Quantity at each location.
Total quantity on hand.
Notes:
Useful for inventory checks and locating items quickly.
Can include filters or sorting options for convenience.
Location Lookup Page

Functionality:
Enables users to view all items stored at a specific location.
Search Options:
By Location Label: Scanned or entered.
Display:
List of items at the location.
Quantities of each item.
Notes:
Helpful for spot checks and organizing specific bays or shelves.
Can include the ability to edit stock levels directly if necessary.
Scan Page

Functionality:
Provides scanning capabilities using the device's camera.
Uses:
Scanning item barcodes.
Scanning location labels.
Integration:
Populates fields in Add, Remove, or Move Stock pages based on scans.
Implementation:
Utilize web-based barcode scanning libraries (e.g., QuaggaJS, ZXing).
Ensure compatibility with mobile browsers and camera permissions.
Notes:
Test across different devices to ensure reliability.
Provide fallback options if scanning fails (e.g., manual entry).
Settings/Administration Page (Optional)

Functionality:
Allows management of items and locations.
Features:
Add or edit item details (name, SKU, barcode).
Add or edit location details.
User management (if authentication is implemented).
Notes:
For an MVP, this can be minimal or restricted to admin users.
Ensure proper validation and error handling.
Additional Considerations

Technology Stack:

Frontend: Next.js (React framework) with shadcn UI components for styling.
Backend: Next.js API routes or a lightweight server if needed.
Database: PostgreSQL for robust data management.
ORM: Prisma or similar to interact with the database efficiently.
Barcode Scanning:

Implement using JavaScript libraries that can access the device camera.
Ensure users grant camera permissions in their browsers.
Provide clear instructions or tutorials for first-time users.
Responsive Design:

Optimize the UI for mobile devices since staff will use their phones.
Use responsive layouts and touch-friendly controls.
Authentication and Security:

Even if skipping for the MVP, plan for future implementation.
Protect sensitive operations with at least basic security measures.
Error Handling and Validation:

Validate all user inputs to prevent incorrect data entry.
Handle exceptions gracefully to maintain a smooth user experience.
Performance Optimization:

Ensure fast load times and responsiveness, especially on mobile networks.
Optimize database queries and use indexing where appropriate.
Scalability:

Design the data models and application structure to accommodate future growth.
Keep code modular to facilitate adding new features later on.
Summary

This plan outlines a simple yet effective Warehouse Management System tailored to your needs:

Core Features: Adding, removing, and moving stock with accurate tracking.
User Interface: Mobile-friendly pages that staff can access via their phones.
Data Integrity: Robust data models ensuring accurate and consistent inventory data.
Ease of Use: Barcode scanning for quick data entry and minimal manual input.
Technology Alignment: Utilizes Next.js and technologies you're comfortable with.
By focusing on these key areas, you'll have an MVP that provides immediate value and a solid foundation for future enhancements.
